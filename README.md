This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How To Run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

then...

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Design/Code Tradeoffs

I utilized props because it was a small project. I did not utilize a state management tool like Redux or the Context API.

Global state is stored in App.js.

Some other components utilize state as well for smaller tasks.

I used local storage to persist data across reloads.

If I were to redesign, I would definitely use Context API because my nested components are sometimes hard to follow.

The code is quite modular, but I could have made even more components if needed.

## Bugs

No known bugs. I hope you don't find any haha.
